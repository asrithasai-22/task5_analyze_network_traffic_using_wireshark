Summary of my Report

I conducted a network traffic capture using Wireshark on my system with IP address 152.57.147.112. During the one-minute capture period while browsing a website, I observed multiple network protocols in action. The primary protocols identified were TCP (for connection establishment), HTTP (for web content transfer), and DNS (for domain name resolution).

Protocols Identified
1) TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Used for establishing reliable connections between my computer (152.57.147.112) and web servers
   
2) HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - Visible in packets containing website requests and responses
 
3)DNS (Domain Name System) - Used to resolve domain names to IP addresses before HTTP connections were established

Packet Details

1)TCP Handshake: Observed the classic SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK sequence

2)HTTP Requests: GET requests for web pages and associated resources

3)DNS Queries: Requests to resolve domain names to IP addresses
